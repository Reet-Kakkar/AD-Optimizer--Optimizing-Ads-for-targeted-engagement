# AD-Optimizer--(optimizing-Ads-for-targeted-engagement)
This project uses data analysis to optimize ad targeting in digital marketing. By analyzing Facebook ad campaign data, we explore factors like demographics, engagement, and timing to identify trends. Clustering and predictive modeling help refine audience segmentation, improving campaign performance and ROI with actionable insights.

# About this project
This project focuses on optimizing advertisement campaigns by analyzing Facebook ad data to understand how various factors—such as age range, gender, clicks, impressions , engagement, approved coversions etc. —affect campaign performance. Using data sourced from Kaggle, the project incorporates Power BI to create interactive dashboards for visualizing key metrics and identifying which demographics respond best to the ads. Additionally, analysis through Python was also done that consisted of data cleaning and to train machine learning models, including Random Forest and a Neural Network, to predict campaign outcomes. The aim is to utilize these insights to reach the most responsive audiences, maximize advertising efficiency, and make informed decisions that improve overall campaign performance.

# Future work:
For future work, this project could be expanded by using additional data sources, such as user engagement metrics or competitor ad performance, to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing campaign success Additionally, real-time ad performance monitoring and optimization could be explored, allowing marketers to make adjustments dynamically during campaigns. Finally,  we can also add A/B testing features to the dashboard would allow marketers to test different versions of ads and adjust their strategies based on real-time results.
